  # README - Huffman File Compressor

Welcome to Huffman File Compressor, a console-based application developed in C++ for compressing and decompressing files using the Huffman Algorithm. This algorithm enables compression by assigning shorter codes to the most frequently used characters or bytes.

## Overview

Huffman File Compressor provides two main functionalities:

1. **Compact:** Compresses a given file using the Huffman Algorithm.
2. **Unzip:** Decompresses a previously compressed file.

The application is entirely coded in C++ and utilizes data structures such as `priority queue`, `binary tree`, and l`inked list` to implement the Huffman Algorithm efficiently.

## Features

1. **File Compression:**
   - Utilizes the Huffman Algorithm to compress files, reducing their size while preserving data integrity.

2. **File Decompression:**
   - Decompresses files that were previously compressed using the Huffman Algorithm, restoring them to their original state.

## Technical Details

- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Data Structures Used:**
   - `Priority Queue`: Used for constructing Huffman trees efficiently.
   - `Binary Tree`: Represents the Huffman tree structure.
   - `Linked List`: Supports various operations required during compression and decompression.

## Usage

To use Huffman File Compressor:

1. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Choose the desired operation:
   - For compression, select the "compact" option and provide the path to the file to be compressed.
   - For decompression, select the "unzip" option and provide the path to the compressed file.
